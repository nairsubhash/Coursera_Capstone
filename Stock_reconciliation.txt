SAP stock reconciliation ewm - Inbound comes in from SAP - We likely need SAP updates (for the inbound??)

If IntegrationID = FRM (Loop through all)
   Save in BI_data dataxml2 with intent to Execute ExecutionGroupID="SAP_Inventory_Update_EWM"
Else If IntegrationID = STR and BI Config value for $EnableStockRecon  = True
   Save in BI_data dataxml2 with intent to Execute ExecutionGroupID="SAP_Inventory_Update_EWM"
Else
    Bypass
End If 

BMS_INT_SAP_Stock_reconciliation_EWM behavior:
select top 1 xml from dataxml2 where TransType = 'SAP_Stock_Reconciliation_EWM'"
Post that xml to Sc_Messages as MES message type - Not clear why this is being done - (Do we intend to send a message to SAP? I do not see corresponding ERP messages)

Update Syncade (QC dates, QC status etc.)
